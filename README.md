An implementation of financial tracking with Ruby on Rails. Ruby Edge is a
continuation of Ledgers - a financial management system for iOS. Ruby Edge was
made due to the need for financial management from multiple platforms.

Ruby Edge allows users to store a log of transactions and track their current
balance. Ruby Edge moves beyond Ledgers with authentication through Google and a
web based interface accessible from any browser.
